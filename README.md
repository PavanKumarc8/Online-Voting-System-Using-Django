# Online-Voting-System-Using-Django
This project implements an online voting system using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Users can view a list of questions, select a question to vote on, view the results of a question, and vote for a choice. The system utilizes Django's powerful features such as models for database interaction and URL routing for navigation.
